This is a search-site I made for a school project. :)

# What is it?
It's a simple search page. That's it.

# Features I want to implement.
* [x] Basic functionality, searching using google.
* [ ] Style it up! :D
* [ ] Ability to choose search engine. (Google, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo, etc.)
* [ ] Ability to use a custom search engine?
* [ ] Choose theme.
* [ ] Save settings/themes in "local storage"?
